# PasswordTracker
A very basic password tracker that is unlocked with a fingerprint sensor. 
  *Uses Google Fingerprint API. 
  *Uses SaharedPreferences to store passwords
  *Has a unique method to parse and disparse all data into a string and store it.

Tested and developed for One Plus Two with Oxygen OS 3.0.2

There will be very little support as this is just a fun project for me. Feel free to use it for any need you might have.
